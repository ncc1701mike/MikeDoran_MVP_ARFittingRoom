=== Demo scene ===

The demo scene can be found in "SolarSystem/Scenes/SimpleScene.unity"


=== Ring shadow ===

If you can't see the ring shadow, please increase Shadow Distance to higher values like 400 in Project Setting - Quality - Shadows.
The rings use their separate layers and lights, so their shadows won't be affected by other objects. For example, Saturn use layer 9. They are managed by RingManager script.


=== Dependency ===

The demo scene requires Post Processing Stack (v2) to have better visual quality.
